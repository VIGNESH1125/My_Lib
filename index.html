                <p id="book_dis">Death Note went out with a bang with its final cover, proving that the series' art is just as good as its suspenseful and brilliant story. 
                    The cover featured Light, L, Near and Mello, with the protagonist stretching his hands in a cross-shape, a reference to his ego and God complex. 
                    As much as he was the main character, his death was quite satisfying given how cruel and self-conceited he had been. Death Note is one of the most popular manga of all time and stands out as one of the best plot-driven series ever.</p>

                <p id="book_dis">A relatively new series, Sakamoto Days has been the talk of the town recently,
                     not just for its action-packed premise that draws comparisons to John Wick, but it also has 
                     art that's hailed as one of Shonen Jump's best in a very long time. 
                     Yuto Suzuki's over-the-top art style, which includes some of the most impressive weaponry 
                     in the series, is depicted in the art that features Gaku with a huge hammer-like weapon that
                      also has spikes. Sakamoto Days is an extremely underrated series is poised to be Shonen Jump's
                    next big manga, 
                    and an eventual anime adaptation looks very realistic.</p>

                <label id="book_label">One Piece</label>
                <p id="book_dis">Although the cover of One Piece's 60th volume wasn't as
                     memorable as the others, it packed the most emotional punch. 
                     Following the end of the epic Marineford arc, Luffy was at the lowest point of his life, 
                     not only witnessing the brutal death of his brother Ace in front of him, but not having his 
                     crew by his side. The cover shows the childhood version of Luffy, Ace, and Sabo, with the arc 
                     diving deeper into the lives of the three brothers. This was by far the saddest stretch 
                     of chapters, as fans truly understood the weight of Luffy's loss. Fortunately, Jimbei and 
                     Rayleigh were there for our beloved rubber man 
                    and helped him recover from the traumatic incident and become stronger.</p>

                    life after all that happened to him in his early years, but he managed to do it. 
                    From adopting a child and a dog, getting a beautiful wife and founding a peaceful city in 
                    Vinland, he became the kind and gentle man he always wished to be, and it was all symbolized 
                    on the cover of Volume 16. Sitting on the farm with his child and 
                    dog on a beautiful sunny day, few people deserved a good life more than Thorfinn.</p>

                    volume is the perfect representation of the story's atmosphere. On a snowy night, 
                    the investigators launched a full-scale assault on a small caf√© called Anteiku which was 
                    a meeting ground for ghouls. The agency wanted to down the Owl, a powerful and extremely 
                    dangerous ghoul that had slaughtered many people years ago but had disappeared ever since. 
                    The night was extremely tragic, not only displacing many ghouls who weren't a threat to humans, 
                    but also the death of Kaneki at the hands of the strongest investigator, Arima.</p>

                    <p id="book_dis">Slam Dunk is the premiere sports comic, and one 
                        of its strongest points was the constantly improving art that 
                        dazzled readers with every turn of the page. Takehiko Inoue was a 
                        brilliant artist, and an even better painter, with his coloring skills 
                        breathing life into his covers and hooking readers even before the book is opened. 
                        Sakuragi and Shuhoko's tough battle against Ryonan was at its peak, and the stakes were
                         higher than ever, with the winner qualifying for the nationals. The art displayed Sakuragi
                          attempting his famous "commoner's shot" with Fukuda attempting to 
                        block him and Akagi preparing himself to grab the rebound.</p>

                    <p id="book_dis">Chainsaw Man's covers are always vibrant, colorful,
                         and full of life, and its first cover is its most iconic. 
                         It sums up the vibe of the series and shows the gore that will be
                          present all throughout. Fujimoto's skills as an illustrator have never been doubted, 
                          with Fire Punch and Goodbye Eri displaying his skill as a mangaka.
                           Although Chainsaw Man had a very noticeable drop in art quality as 
                           compared to his previous works, he let loose when it came to the manga covers. 
                           From using bright and varying colors to giving fans a hint of what's to come,
                         Chainsaw Man was a great example of cover art done right.</p>

                        20 is especially an eye-catcher, not only perfectly displaying the true beauty of Yusuke 
                        Murata's art style but also featuring many of the S-rank heroes in an epic start to the series'
                         biggest battle between humanity and the monsters. Murata stands out for his realistic art style,
                          but his coloring and shading are 
                        also a huge point of strength for the new founder of an anime studio.</p>

                        the most beautiful journeys in fiction. The 28th cover was the first to show his new 
                        persona as a man who finally achieved inner peace and set his priorities straight. 
                        With his hands together in a praying gesture and a statue behind him, this cover was a 
                        tribute to the painful journey of the Japanese legend from centuries ago before becoming a
                         philosopher and an 
                        incredible swordsman who left his legacy and mark for many years to come.</p>

                        The 70th volume was especially visually appealing, featuring Indra and Ashura, 
                        Madara and Hashirama, and Naruto and Sasuke, with Hagoromo at the center. 
                        This powerful piece was a comparison of the most powerful shinobi and enemies
                         who were closer than blood, but their relationship turned sour. The genius and 
                         cold-hearted Indra reincarnated as Madara and Sasuke, while the hardworking and 
                         kind Ashura reincarnated as Hashirama and Naruto, showing that Naruto and Sasuke's
                          fate had already 
                        played out two times, but they also had the chance to do it differently.</p>
